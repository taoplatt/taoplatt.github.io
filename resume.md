## **Selected project experience**  

### **GIZ:** Kenyan ICT Skills and Export Strategy  
> **Project Manager, Feb 2023 – ongoing**  
Genesis Analytics, in collaboration with GIZ and the ICT Authority of Kenya, is formulating a strategy to unlock inclusive employment in Kenya by scaling in-demand ICT services. This exercise will map the existing distribution of ICT professionals and supply of ICT graduates in Kenya. It will then conduct a strategic foresight analysis, mapping expected supply and demand of ICT professionals in three years time, accounting for important macrotrends like AI and automation. The strategy will conclude by outlining interventions that will feasibly and sustainably close the most material gaps between supply and demand. Tao is the project manager for the assignment, responsible for conceptualising and delivering the work with a team of junior colleagues. This involves presentations, budgeting, leading the strategy formulation process and more.

### **CRASA:** Study on Regulatory Autonomy and Independence  
> **Senior Associate, Jan 2024 – April 2024**  
The objective of the project is to conduct a comprehensive study on regulatory independence and autonomy of communications regulators in the SADC region, for the Communications Regulators' Association of Southern Africa. The study will inform the development of a position paper on regulatory independence and autonomy in the communications sector. Tao is a key consultant on the assignment, setting the budget and work plan, formulating the survey questionnaire, and supporting the dissemination of findings.

### **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:** Digital Innovation in the Public Sector  
> **Research Manager, Oct 2023 – ongoing**  
The DIPS initiative aims to inclusively strengthen the resilience of vulnerable South Africans using fit-for-purpose, standards driven and integrated data and technology to improve the harmonization, design and delivery of pro-poor government services and benefits. The programme will implement pilots that digitise select clusters of pro-poor government services, aiming to improve policy design, resource allocation and delivery incrementally. These pilots will start with a “Proof of Concept'' phase, which will focus on integrating separate datasets so that they function together in an interoperable manner, to have a better analytical base for social policy decisions. The programme will also look to stimulate broader government support for digitisation, moving toward a longer-term whole-of-government vision for using data intelligence to inform improved, evidence-based policymaking, as well as delivering pro-poor government services through data, digital ID and digital payments. Tao is the research manager of this assignment. This entails, among other roles: leading a team of multiple junior consultants, setting workstream research agendas,  leading stakeholder consultations (including senior government stakeholders), setting work plans and organising workshops.

### **Amazon Web Services:** Cloud regulations as an enabler of AI in MEA  
> **Senior Associate, Oct 2023 – Dec 2023**  
AI potential for key industries to produce economic and socio-economic benefits have a dependency on access and use of cloud technology and innovation. Policy and regulatory approaches can place restraints on access to cloud technology and innovation and limit AI potential. This Report considers policy and regulatory approaches to AI and Cloud in the Middle East and Africa, including data protection, consumer protection and cybersecurity regulation to understand barriers to AI in cloud uptake. This Report makes recommendations to regulators on how to strike a balance between regulatory safeguards and enabling AI innovation in the Middle East and Africa. This project recommends stakeholder engagement and communications to sensitise regulators on balanced approaches to regulation. Tao is a key consultant on this assignment, responsible for research, drafting and providing technical guidance to a junior consultant.

### **DAI & USAID:** Cross-sectoral digital services guidance note  
> **Project Manager, April 2023 – November 2023**  
Digital technologies have the potential to improve lives in low and middle-income countries by broadening access to information, goods, and services. However, many digital solutions \- particularly in the world of agriculture, resilience, nutrition and water, security, sanitation and hygiene (WSSH) \- are designed, developed and deployed in silos. Fragmented digital solutions formulated in silos can result in poor user experiences, entrenched information blockages, constrained uptake and artificially limited scope. Genesis Analytics partnered with USAID and DAI under the Digital Frontiers initiative to formulate a practical guidance note to address this challenge. The note equips USAID mission staff, advisors and implementing partners working in agriculture, resilience, nutrition, and WSSH to deliver digital solutions that holistically meet a variety of program participant needs, by breaking the right silos in solution design, deployment and delivery. Tao was the project manager, leading the research and delivery of the toolkit. This involved organising user testing workshops, leading a team of junior consultants, leading stakeholder interviews, and disseminating the toolkit to the broader audience, including giving a keynote address at USAID’s ICT4Ag conference.

### **MasterCard Foundation:** BPO and ITO strategy for Uganda  
> **Project Manager, July 2023 – October 2023**  
Genesis Analytics, in collaboration with the Mastercard Foundation and the BPO & Innovation Council of Uganda, spearheaded the research for Uganda's BPO & ITO sector strategy. This strategy proposed strategic interventions to address key barriers to sector growth, aiming to unlock 100 000 jobs for young people by 2030\. The research team employed an adapted strategy cascade model to guide the research, addressing three critical questions: the sector’s aspirations, where Uganda should position itself in the market, and the necessary capabilities to develop for achieving the aspiration. Tao was the project manager, leading a team of junior consultants, organising and leading stakeholder interviews, presenting at co-creation and validation workshops, and ultimately delivering a strategy that was accepted and owned by the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance in Uganda.

### **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:** Inclusively advancing AI and automation in agri-food systems in low and middle income countries   
> **Associate & Project Manager, August 2022 – Mar 2023**  
Genesis Analytics was tasked with analysing the current and emergent state of AI and automation in agri-food systems in countries where USAID and BMGF work. The study pinpoints priority areas of opportunity for BMGF and USAIDs’ program officers to actualise the significant potential of AI and automation in agriculture, particularly in lower and middle income countries. The assignment explored why AI is relevant to small-scale producers in LMICs; the impacts of AI and automation on small-scale producers; and considerations for inclusively advancing AI and automation in agri-food systems. Genesis took a phased approach, first conducting a diagnostic assessment of the AI use cases and impacts, before co-creating recommendations for intervention and investment via multiple stakeholder workshops. Tao project managed the latter phase, organising the workshops, setting the agenda, working with junior colleagues to collate and synthesise the insights, and validating the recommendations with BMGF, USAID and the broader Agtech ecosystem.
